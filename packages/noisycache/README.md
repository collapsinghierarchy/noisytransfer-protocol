# @noisytransfer/noisycache (DEPRECATED)

> This package is no longer published or maintained. Its functionality has been superseded by a combination of:
>
> - **@noisytransfer/noisystream** — frame-based streaming with flow control and final signatures.
> - **@noisytransfer/crypto** — AEAD streams (HPKE exporter) and hash/sign helpers.

The package is now marked `"private": true` in `package.json` to prevent future publishes.
